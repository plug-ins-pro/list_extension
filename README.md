Plug-in for Oracle Application Express (APEX) by United Codes

List Extension is designed to improve user experience when adding new values to an existing List of Values (LOV). Users can quickly and easily add a new value to an existing Select List, Popup LOV, Radio Group, Checkbox, or Shuttle and automatically select the newly created value - all without leaving the page they are working on or losing their place in the application!
